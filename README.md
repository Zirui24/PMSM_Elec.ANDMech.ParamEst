# PMSM_Elec.Mech.ParameterEstimation
This repository demonstrates the model-based synchronous machine electrical & mechanical parameter estimation where the magnetic cross-coupling saturation and speed ripple caused by extra signal excitation is well considered. Eevn so, the torque ripple caused is used as a excitation in mechanical equation to estimate the inertia and damping term.
